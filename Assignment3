For this assignment, you will use the urllib library (https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html) to retrieve a web page.  You will retrieve the ‘Uplink Summary’ page from a Jupiter terminal and then use Beautiful Soup to pull out some information from the page.  Finally, you will write some key statistics to a text file.

If you would like to connect to an actual Jupiter terminal (which I would like you to do), you will need to run your program from your office PC.  I’ve include a function snippet below that will setup the required proxy in order to connect to a terminal in the field.

def setup_proxy():
    proxy_handler = urllib.request.ProxyHandler({'http': '66.82.3.130:80'})
    opener = urllib.request.build_opener(proxy_handler)
    urllib.request.install_opener(opener)


Here is the URL you will need get the Uplink Summary stats from my home terminal:
http://gue000000756.terminal.jupiter.hnops.net/cgi-bin/command.cgi?CommandStr=_COM_SYSMON_STATS?=1

If you can’t work on this from your office PC or if you would like to start with an example local file, I’ve attached an example output HTML file.

After retrieving the HTML file, use Beautiful Soup to pull out the following information:
-          Stream ACKs, Stream NAKs
-          SCMA Data ACKs, SCMA Data NAKs,
-          Packet (PDU) Sent, Packets (PDU) Dropped

An example of what the Uplink Summary page looks like is below:






Lastly, scoring will be as follows:
-          Program runs without error: 1 point
-          Python is PEP8 compliant (see http://pep8online.com/): 1 point
-          Uplink summary page is retrieved using urllib: 2 points
-          Beautiful Soup is used to parse out stats mentioned above: 4 points
-          Output text file is created with stats mentioned above: 2 points
-          Extra Credit: Regular expression is used along with Beautiful Soup to parse out stats: 1 point

Let me know if you have any questions.
